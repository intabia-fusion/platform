# Team Planner: FilterBar/FilterButton project filter (FUSIO-1308)

Область: [Планировщик / Календарь](../features/planner-calendar.md)

## Own ClassFilters mixin on time.class.ToDo

`FilterBar`/`FilterButton` (`plugins/view-resources/src/components/filter/`) only render options for a class that has `view.mixin.ClassFilters` registered (`FilterTypePopup.getOwnTypes`: `hierarchy.classHierarchyMixin(_class, view.mixin.ClassFilters) === undefined` -> returns `[]`, and `FilterBar` hides its row entirely on the same check). Mounting them on a class without the mixin compiles but is inert - an empty "+" popup.

`models/time/src/index.ts` registers the mixin for `time.class.ToDo`:

```ts
builder.mixin(time.class.ToDo, core.class.Class, view.mixin.ClassFilters, {
  filters: ['attachedSpace', 'user'],
  strict: true
})
```

`strict: true` limits the popup to exactly these two - project and person are the only things the team views can act on, anything else offered there would silently do nothing.

`attachedSpace` is declared `@Prop(TypeRef(task.class.Project), ...)` in `TToDo` (`models/time/src/index.ts`) even though its type is `Ref<Space>`: the filter enumerates the referenced class, so typing it as `Space` would offer every space in the workspace. `user` is `Ref<Employee>` and needs nothing extra.

`plugins/time-resources/src/components/team/TeamContent.svelte` mounts one `FilterButton`/ `FilterBar` pair on `time.class.ToDo` and pulls `attachedSpace`/`user` out of the resulting `DocumentQuery<ToDo>` into `spaces: Ref<Project>[]` / `filterPersons: Ref<Person>[]`, threaded down into `Calendar`/`Agenda`/`YearCalendar` -> `WithTeamData`. Its `toRefs` handles only the `$in` mode - `$nin` ("not in") is silently ignored, still a real gap.

## `WithTeamData` generalized from single `space` to `spaces: Ref<Project>[]`

FilterBar's default filter mode is multi-select (`$in`), so `WithTeamData`/`TeamCalendar`/ `TeamCalendarDay`/`Agenda` all take `spaces`/`projects` (arrays) instead of a single `space`/`project`. `TeamCalendarDay` (day-by-hour) still only makes sense for exactly one project - `Calendar.svelte` gates the "day" mode option on `spaces.length === 1`.

## `PersonCalendar.svelte`'s day-offset math is symmetric around `startDate`, not 1..N

`values`/`getDay(startDate, offset)` always builds a window of `offset ∈ [-sideDays, +sideDays]` around `startDate` - the `currentDate` prop cancels out of the arithmetic (`value - currentDate.getDate()` reduces to `±offset`). For "Month" mode this means `startDate` must be the *middle* of the month (day ~16), not day 1 - `Calendar.svelte` computes `monthPivot = new Date(y, m, 16)` and passes `maxDays = daysInMonth(currentDate)`. Because `sideDays = Math.round((maxDays-1)/2)` rounds up for even `maxDays`, a 28/29/30-day month renders one extra trailing column that bleeds into the next month - pre-existing component limitation, not fixed (would need touching `PersonCalendar`'s shared offset formula, risking the week view).

## Year view is its own component, BusySlot-only

`team/calendar/YearCalendar.svelte` queries `calendar.class.BusySlot` directly (not through `WithTeamData`) for the whole year, once, only while mounted (i.e. only when "Year" mode is selected) - a full-year all-employee query is too heavy to run eagerly. Per-month aggregation calls `getBusyIntervals` (`plugins/calendar/src/utils.ts`) once per month bucket over the same fetched slice. Self's own events are not special-cased (unlike `WithTeamData`, which excludes `me` from the BusySlot query and sources self's events from `calendar.class.Event`/`WorkSlot` instead) - `syncBusySlot` (`server-plugins/calendar-resources/src/index.ts`) mirrors every participant of a blocking event into `BusySlot`, self included, so a uniform BusySlot-only query is accurate for all rows.
