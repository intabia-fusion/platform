# Component tests in packages/ui (vitest)

Область: [Testing](../testing.md)

`packages/ui` runs **vitest**, not jest (`vitest.config.mts`, `pnpm test` -> `vitest run --silent`). The rig's test phase sees a non-jest `test` script and runs the package isolated via `pnpm run test`, so no rig change was needed.

Non-obvious pieces, all of them required to make a `.svelte` component mount in jsdom:

- `resolve.conditions: ['browser']` - without it svelte resolves to its SSR runtime and **`onMount` never fires**. The component still renders DOM, so the failure looks like "the component is mounted but half its state is missing" (`parentElement` stays undefined, drags do nothing).
- `workspaceSources()` plugin in the config - workspace packages point `main` at raw `.ts`, which vite refuses as a package entry ("Failed to resolve entry for package @hcengineering/theme").
- `src/__test__/setup.ts` - jsdom ships neither `window.matchMedia` (pulled in by plyr via the ui index) nor `PointerEvent`.
- jsdom does no layout: every `getBoundingClientRect` is zero. `Separator.test.ts` installs a fake layout (`src/__test__/fakeLayout.ts`) that derives widths from the inline styles the component writes and hands the remainder to the auto panels.
- `deviceOptionsStore.fontSize` defaults to 0, so rem-to-px maths collapses unless the test sets it.

Separator's own layout maths lives in `src/separatorLayout.ts` (`buildLayout` / `distribute` / `toSeparators`) - pure functions over plain data, covered by 112 generated combinations in `separatorLayout.test.ts`. The component keeps only DOM reading and style writing.

## Coverage today

`Separator.test.ts` covers horizontal drag, vertical drag, the layout switch regression, a hidden (float-configured but absent) panel, float mode and the window-resize crop. `separatorLayout.test.ts` covers the pure maths over the 112 generated combinations plus a coarse O(n^2) guard.

Two things surfaced while writing them:

- `direction` used to be a `const` inside the component, so the vertical branches were dead code. It is now `export let direction` (default `'horizontal'`), which makes them reachable and testable.
- Float mode can only ever **shrink** a panel: `floatMouseMove` clamps the pointer to the panel being resized (`parentCoord` is capped at `parentSize.size - separatorSize`), so a floating panel never grows past its current width. `Separator.test.ts` pins that as current behaviour with a comment, not as a desired one.

## Benchmarks

`pnpm bench` (`vitest bench --run`) in `packages/ui`:
- `separatorLayout.bench.ts` - buildLayout / distribute / full drag step at 3, 10 and 50 panels.
- `Separator.bench.ts` - 60 pointermove events through the mounted component in jsdom. Benchmarks are excluded from `pnpm test` (`test.include` only matches `*.test.ts`).

## Separator: panel swap without a config change

The planner keeps `separatorName = 'time'` for both Schedule and Team (`showToDos` is true in both), so switching between them replaces only the **panel node** next to the separator - no prop of the separator changes. `afterUpdate` called `checkSibling()` without `start`, which refreshed `prevElement`/`nextElement` only when they were `null`; they pointed at detached nodes instead, so the replacement panel never got `data-size`/`data-auto` and collapsed to min-content (2px in the wild).

`checkSibling` now compares against the separator's actual siblings and returns whether they changed; `afterUpdate` then calls `sizeNewSiblings()`, which sizes only the panels that carry no `data-size`/`data-auto` yet, so it never fights a panel another code path already sized. Covered by "sizes a panel swapped in without a config change" in `Separator.test.ts`.

## Separator: in-memory config went stale after a drag

`finalSeparation` wrote the new sizes to `localStorage` but left the component's own `separators` / `prevElSize` / `nextElSize` untouched - they still held the sizes from the last `fetchSeparators` (which only runs when `name` or `float` changes). Nothing read them right after a drag, so it stayed invisible until `afterUpdate` started re-running sizing on a panel swap: the swapped-in panel was then sized from the pre-drag config (the planner's calendar snapped back to the default 41.25rem after the user had dragged it to 53.75rem).

`finalSeparation` now assigns the freshly computed config back to `separators`. Covered by "applies the dragged size to a panel swapped in afterwards".

## Review follow-ups (same session)

- `separatorsRevision` (in `resize.ts`) is bumped by `saveSeparator`. Several `Separator` components share one config - the planner has one per gap - and each kept its own copy from mount time, so a drag on one left the other stale. Each separator now re-reads the config when the revision for its name moves.
- `direction` reacts to a change: both axes are cleared (`clearContainer` now wipes width **and** height) and sizes re-applied, otherwise the panels keep min/max from the previous axis.
- `installFakeLayout` (`src/__test__/fakeLayout.ts`) stores the native `getBoundingClientRect` unbound (a `.bind(Element.prototype)` would restore a function whose `this` is the prototype) and refuses a second install, so the fake can never become the restore target.
- `distribute` behaviour pinned by two tests: the auto panel next to the separator takes the whole growth; with a sized panel in between, the growth skips it and is split between the auto panels further out.
