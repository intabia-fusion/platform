## What is inside

One repository, one build, a set of applications on a shared framework:

| Application | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Tracker** | Issues, sub-issues, estimations, time reports, Kanban with swim-lanes |
| **Chat** | Channels and DMs, threads, replies and forwards, read receipts, web push |
| **Documents / QMS** | Collaborative editing, controlled documentation, markdown export |
| **Meetings** | Virtual office and video on LiveKit, including self-hosted installations |
| **AI Bot** | Kafka-backed assistant with persistent memory, meeting summaries |
| **Planner, Drive, HR, Contacts** | Personal planning, files, org structure, CRM-style contacts |
| **Integrations** | Telegram, Gmail, GitHub, calendars, Stripe billing, REST + WebSocket API |

</table>

## Quick start

Requires [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
and Docker Compose.

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm boot            # build + build Docker images + start the local stand
```

Then open <http://localhost:8087>, select "Sign up" and create a workspace.

Even shorter, from a clean checkout:

```bash
sh ./scripts/fast-start.sh
```

Details, dev-server mode, watch builds and troubleshooting:
[**Getting started**](./docs/getting-started.md).
