# Intabia Platform

TypeScript/Svelte 4 monorepo. pnpm workspaces, Node 24 (`.nvmrc`; engines accept >=20 <25), Webpack 5, Electron, Jest.

## Repository Structure

- `models/*` - Shared types/models. New components go to api/resources/model package
- `server/*`, `server-plugins/*` - Server packages (account, workspace, backup, pipeline; per-plugin triggers)
- `plugins/*` - Client plugins: `<x>` (ids/types), `<x>-resources` (Svelte UI), `<x>-assets` (i18n, icons)
- `foundations/*` - Core framework: `core` (model, client, query), `server` (server core, middleware, DB/storage/Kafka adapters), `hulylake`, `stream` (Go media service), `net`, `utils`
- `packages/*` - Reusable utilities, UI kit (`packages/ui`, `packages/presentation`)
- `pods/*` - Deployable service bundles
- `services/*` - Standalone services (ai-bot, love, billing, telegram, calendar, ...)
- `desktop/`, `desktop-package/` - Electron app
- `dev/` - Dev-server, docker-compose, local tooling
- `tests/`, `ws-tests/`, `qms-tests/` - Integration/e2e (Playwright, Docker)
- `common/` - Shared scripts, config, pnpm patches, git hooks
- `docs/` - Project documentation, index in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)

Projects sit 2-3 levels deep, each with its own `package.json`.

## Where features live

Before searching the code for a feature, open the feature map [`docs/features/README.md`](docs/features/README.md): one file per product area (tracker, chat, meetings, documents/QMS, AI, billing, ...) with the packages, data model, main flows with files and symbols, and a "where to look if you need to..." list. How the pieces fit together (plugin layers, client -> transactor -> DB path, pods and services): [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

The map is maintained with the code: a change that adds, moves or removes a user-visible feature, a key class or an entry point updates the matching `docs/features/<area>.md` in the same PR. Each file carries the commit it was last checked against; a path in it that no longer exists is a bug in the docs.

## Session memory (`docs/memory/`)

One file per topic, for what the code and git history do NOT already say: a root cause that took digging, a third-party quirk with its file:line, a constant whose value came from a measurement.

Keep it minimal. No narrative, no restating the fix, no "what we tried" - a fact per line, with the number or the reference that makes it checkable. If a line would be obvious to anyone reading the code it touches, drop it. Prefer editing an existing file over adding a near-duplicate; delete a note once it stops being true.

## UI Components

Before writing a new `.svelte` component, check [`docs/ui-components/`](docs/ui-components/README.md): catalogs of `@hcengineering/ui`, `@hcengineering/presentation` and `plugins/view-resources` (purpose + key props per component, "which of the similar ones" guide, `view.component.*` registry) and the two ways to reuse a component across plugins without a dependency cycle.

The catalog is maintained with the code, in the same PR: adding, renaming or removing an exported component (or its key props, or a `view.component.*` id) in those three packages updates the matching table row; a new component that overlaps an existing one gets a bullet in "Выбор между похожими". Rules in the catalog README.

## Build & Validation

Use `pnpm build:*` from the repo root. All accept `--to PKG` to scope to a package + dependencies.

Type checking is **part of the build**: one native `tsc` (TypeScript 7) pass per package emits `lib/` and `types/` together. There is no separate validate phase.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile    # Install deps
pnpm build                        # Compile + typecheck (JS + .d.ts)
pnpm bundle                       # Compile + bundle
pnpm package                      # Compile + bundle + package
pnpm docker                       # Compile + bundle + docker build (local stand pods)
pnpm docker:build                 # Same, every package with a docker phase
pnpm svelte-check                 # Compile + svelte-check
pnpm build:watch                  # Watch + rebuild
pnpm --filter PKG add DEP         # Add dependency to a package (from anywhere)
pnpm -w run SCRIPT                # Run a root script from any directory in the tree
```

`pnpm run` only sees the nearest `package.json`, so from inside a package use `pnpm -w run` to reach the root scripts (`pnpm -w run docker:up`). After adding a dependency by hand, run `pnpm check-versions` - nothing enforces a single version across packages on its own.

The workspace is plain pnpm: projects are listed in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the lockfile is `pnpm-lock.yaml` at the root. Rush is gone; `rush`/`rushx` no longer exist. `pnpm check-versions` replaces `rush check`.

Flags: `--to PKG`, `--list`, `-v/--verbose`, `--force` (disable cache).

### Tests

Three groups, told apart by file name - see [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

```bash
pnpm test           # unit (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts) - no Docker, part of the build phase
pnpm integration    # *.itest.ts - starts its own containers, needs only Docker
pnpm bench          # *.bench.ts - by hand only
pnpm coverage       # per-package table + lcov/cobertura/html reports in coverage/
```

A test that needs a service belongs in `*.itest.ts`; renaming the file is the whole
mechanism, nothing else lists the groups.

### Scoped check after edits

```bash
# Strict: compile + typecheck + eslint. Default check.
pnpm build:lint --to @hcengineering/<pkg>

# Lighter: compile + typecheck only.
pnpm build --to @hcengineering/<pkg>
```

`build:lint` is a superset of `build`. Cache is content-hashed; add `--force` to bypass.

Per-package direct (fastest inside one package):

```bash
cd <package-dir>
pnpm run build
```

Not every package defines `lint`. On "command not defined", use `pnpm run build` or `pnpm build:lint --to <pkg>`.

Two TypeScript versions are in play: packages depend on 6.0.3, which eslint, ts-jest and a package's own `node_modules/.bin/tsc` use, while the build compiles with the `typescript7` alias (`npm:typescript@7.0.2`) through `compile`. The two are companion releases of the same checker (7 is the Go port), so `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json` inside a package is a valid quick typecheck - `pnpm run build` remains the authoritative one.

Do NOT:
- Run `pnpm build` without `--to` for error checking (hits unrelated broken packages).
- Run `pnpm run format` (user handles it).

### Docker Workflow

Changes under `services/` or `pods/` require Docker rebuild:

```bash
pnpm docker:build --to @hcengineering/pod-ai-bot
docker compose -f dev/docker-compose.yaml up -d aibot --force-recreate
```

UI via `pnpm build:watch` auto-picks changes, no container restart needed.

## Changelog

```bash
git log --pretty=format:'- %h %s' <range> | grep -v -F 'Merge remote-tracking' | sed -E 's/\s*Signed-off-by:.*$//'
```

Full workflow: `docs/changelog.update.task.md`.

## Sanity tests (Playwright)

Run from `tests/sanity/`. Stand must be up at `localhost:8083`. Always use `pnpm run uitest` - it wires `LOCAL_URL`, `DEV_URL` and the config.

```bash
cd tests/sanity

pnpm run uitest                                   # full suite
pnpm run uitest -g "<title>"                      # one test
pnpm run uitest tests/tracker/kanban.spec.ts      # one file
pnpm run uitest --workers=1                       # serial; sanity tests share workspace state
```

Flags:
- `--workers=1` - serial. Use for love/meeting tests, they share workspace state.
- `-g "<name>"` or append `:LINE` to the spec path to run a single test.
- Extra playwright flags pass through `pnpm run uitest` unchanged.

Do not run bare `npx playwright test` - without `pnpm run uitest`'s env wiring and `-c ./tests/playwright.config.ts` neither dotenv nor `storageState` load, and every test fails on login with `BadRequest`.

### Tracing and retries

`on-first-retry` everywhere, local and CI alike. A green run then pays nothing, and a failure that reproduces is traced by its own retry. Override with `TRACE_MODE` (`retain-on-failure`, `on`, `off`, `on-all-retries`); an unknown value warns and falls back to the default.

**Turn tracing up when hunting a flake.** `on-first-retry` traces the retry, which for a flake is the attempt that *passed* - the trace shows a green run and says nothing about why the first one failed. `TRACE_MODE=retain-on-failure` keeps the failing attempt's trace instead, at the cost of recording every test: a full trace (`snapshots` + `screenshots` + `sources`, ~18MB per test) is written for all of them and thrown away on pass. That is the whole reason it is not the default - it roughly doubles a local run. Turn it on for the run where you are chasing the flake, off again after.

`--retries=0` is no longer needed to keep runs fast either way. The same default and the same `TRACE_MODE` override apply to `qms-tests/sanity` and `ws-tests/sanity`.

`html` is configured with `open: 'never'`; without it the reporter parks a server on failure and hangs the terminal.

Reports after a run: `playwright-report/index.html`, `playwright-report.json` (machine-readable twin), `allure-results/`, traces under `test-results/`.

### Reading a failed run

Do not dig through the html report by hand:

```bash
cd tests/sanity && node analyze_failures.js     # real failures vs flakes, grouped by error
node analyze_failures.js --all                  # every test, not just the top ones
```

A test that passed on a retry is a flake; one still red after its retries is a real failure. The tool groups both by error class and by file, prints ready-to-paste `show-trace` commands and the slowest tests. Locally the suite runs at roughly 7% first-attempt flakiness, so a large flake count is normal - what matters is the real-failure number. Local-only failures around love/meetings usually mean LiveKit, not a regression; CI is the reference.

The evidence of a run is destroyed by the next one. `test-results/` is wiped when a run starts, and *any* invocation through this config rewrites `playwright-report.json` and `playwright-report/` - including `playwright test --list`, which leaves a report of 416 skipped tests behind. Copy what you need before rerunning:

```bash
cp -r test-results /tmp/run-$(date +%s)      # error-context.md, screenshots, traces
cp playwright-report.json /tmp/
```

### Whole-run profiling

`tests/do-test.sh` brings the stand up, runs the suite and reports hot paths across every pod:

```bash
cd tests
./do-test.sh                       # prepare stand, run tests
./do-test.sh --profile             # + CPU-profile every Node pod, print a hot-path report
./do-test.sh --profile --heap      # sample allocations instead
./do-test.sh --no-prepare -g "X"   # reuse a running stand
./do-test.sh --report-only         # re-report from ./profiles
```

The service list is generated from the running compose project by `gen-profile-overlay.js`, so a branch that adds or drops a pod needs no edit. Profiles land in `tests/profiles/<service>/`; `./profile-report.sh` resolves frames back to source through each bundle's source map and refuses to resolve when the bundle on disk no longer matches the one the container ran. Collect only via `./profile-collect.sh` or `docker compose stop` - a SIGKILL loses the profile. Details in `tests/readme.md`.

For everything love/meetings (model, protocols, defects, test setup with LiveKit and `meetings-ws`), see [`docs/love.md`](docs/love.md).
